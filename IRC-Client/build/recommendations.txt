IRC CLIENT USER GUIDE
---------------------

|IMPORTANT| - DO NOT SHARE ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION WHEN INSIDE A SERVER!!


SECURITY
--------
-> Do not use your real name or any sensitive information as your username: Choose a unique and anonymous nickname to protect your identity.
-> Avoid sharing personal or sensitive information in public or private chats: Remember that any information shared on a server can potentially be seen or logged by others.
-> Be cautious when clicking on links: Links sent in channels or private messages may lead to phishing sites or malware.
-> Use strong passwords: If registering your nickname or account, ensure your password is strong and unique to prevent unauthorized access.
-> Report suspicious activity: If you encounter any suspicious behavior or receive unsolicited messages, consider reporting the user or blocking them.


RECOMMENDATIONS
---------------
-> Familiarize yourself with IRC commands: Commands like /whois, /ignore, and /query are useful for managing your experience and protecting your privacy. (Check Useful commands)
-> Join trusted channels: Stick to known and reputable channels to minimize the risk of interacting with malicious users.
-> Log out after use: If youâ€™re using the client on a shared device, make sure to log out and close the application properly.
-> Keep your client up to date: Regular updates help protect against vulnerabilities.
-> Be mindful of channel rules: Each channel may have its own rules regarding behavior and acceptable content. Follow them to avoid being banned or reported.


WARNINGS
--------
-> Private messages are not fully secure: Treat private conversations as potentially public, especially if the server or client lacks end-to-end encryption.
-> Beware of unsolicited file transfers: Do not accept files from users you do not trust, as they could contain viruses or malware.
-> Admins and operators are not always trustworthy: Server administrators and channel operators have elevated permissions but are not immune to abusing them.
-> Do not assume anonymity: IRC networks may log messages, and your IP address is visible unless using a proxy or VPN.
-> Phishing attempts: Be wary of messages asking for account credentials or directing you to input personal information on external websites.
-> Stay safe and enjoy using our IRC client responsibly!
